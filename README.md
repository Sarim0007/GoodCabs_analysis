## Problem Statement:
Goodcabs, a cab service company, operates in 10 tier-2 cities in India and supports local drivers while providing excellent service to passengers. The company has set ambitious growth and passenger satisfaction targets for 2024. 

The Chief of Operations needs immediate insights into key performance metrics, including trip volume, passenger satisfaction, repeat passenger rate, trip distribution, and the balance between new and repeat passengers. 

However, due to the analytics manager's unavailability, the task has been assigned to me, to analyze these metrics and deliver actionable insights.


## Goal & Purpose:
The goal of this project is to deliver actionable insights on Goodcabs' performance in 10 tier-2 cities by analyzing key metrics,

- Identify growth opportunities by understanding trip trends. 
- Enhance passenger satisfaction through targeted improvements. 
- Boost customer retention by increasing repeat passenger rates. 
- Optimize operations by balancing new and repeat passenger engagement. 
- Support strategic decision-making to achieve 2024 performance targets.

## Primary Analysis: 

1. Identify the top 3 and bottom 3 cities by total trips over the entire analysis period.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PuranjoyPatra/Resume_Project_Challenge13/refs/heads/master/images/Primary-Analysis-Output/PA1.png">
</p>

2. Calculate the average fare per trip for each city and compare it with the city's average trip distance. Identify the cities with the highest and lowest average fare per trip to assess pricing efficiency across locations.

</p>

3. Calculate the average passenger and driver ratings for each city, segmented by passenger type (new vs. repeat). Identify cities with the highest and lowest average ratings.

<p align="center"><strong> Higher </strong></p>

</p>

4. For each city, identify the month with the highest total trips (peak demand) and the month with the lowest total trips (low demand). 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PuranjoyPatra/Resume_Project_Challenge13/refs/heads/master/images/Primary-Analysis-Output/PA4.png">
</p>

5. Compare the total trips taken on weekdays versus weekends for each city over the six-month period. Identify cities with a strong preference for either weekend or weekday trips to understand demand variations.

## Secondary Analysis:

1. Factors Influencing Repeat Passenger Rates

- Higher repeat passenger rates may correlate with better passenger ratings, indicating quality service.
- Competitive pricing might attract more repeat passengers in cities with a price-sensitive demographic.
- Socioeconomic factors: Cities with higher-income groups may prefer premium services, whereas lower-income groups may prefer cost-effective services.
- Lifestyle patterns: Cities with high professional populations (e.g., IT hubs) may show consistent repeat usage during weekdays.

2. Tourism vs. Business Demand Impact

- Cross-referenced trip data with event calendars (festivals, conferences, tourism seasons) over 6 months.
- Cities with high tourism activities (e.g., Jaipur, Kochi) show demand spikes during festive seasons or vacations.
- Business-oriented cities (e.g., Lucknow, Surat) show consistent weekday demand.

3. Emerging Mobility Trends and Goodcabs' Adaptation

- Evaluate trends like adoption of electric vehicles, passenger preferences for green energy, and emerging mobility needs.
- Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption: Growing preference for green transport in tier-2 cities. EV could reduce operational costs and appeal to environmentally conscious passengers.
- Sustainability Focus: Eco-conscious passengers favor ride-sharing and low-emission options.

4. Partnership Opportunities with Local Businesses

- Reviewed trip destinations to identify potential partnerships with hotels, malls, and event venues.
- Popular tourist destinations and business centers could be leveraged for tie-ups.
- Partnerships with event venues (e.g., offering discounts for rides to events) could drive loyalty

5. Data Collection for Enhanced Data-Driven Decisions

- Passenger data: Frequency of use, feedback on service quality, and referral usage.
- Driver data: Availability, on-time performance, and training status.
- Market trends: Competition metrics like pricing and service offerings in each city.
- City-specific events: Add event calendars to better predict demand fluctuations

## Recommendations:

- Focus on improving service quality and offering personalized pricing plans for cities with lower repeat rates.
- Tailor marketing efforts to highlight tourism-related campaigns in high-demand periods and offer flexible services for business travelers e.g., loyalty program, ride packages for conferences.
- Gradually integrate electric or hybrid vehicles in tier-2 cities to stay competitive and consider offering discounts on eco-friendly rides.
- Collaborate with local businesses to offer joint promotions for e.g., free rides for shopping above a certain spend.
- Establish partnerships with event venues for exclusive discounts or bundled deals.
- Invest in a feedback system to collect qualitative data on passenger satisfaction and driver performance. Use predictive analytics to optimize supply-demand matching.
